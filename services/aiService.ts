    Based on the following tournament data (in JSON format), provide a concise yet insightful analysis of the team's performance.
    All monetary values are in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT). Please use the 'à§³' symbol for currency.
    
    Your analysis for Team Crossbow should be formatted in markdown and include:
    1.  A brief **Overall Summary** of the performance, including net profit/loss (in BDT).
    2.  **Key Strengths**: Identify what the team is doing well (e.g., performance in high-prizepool tournaments, consistency).
    3.  **Areas for Improvement**: Pinpoint weaknesses (e.g., poor win rate, high average position, struggles in certain tournament types).
    4.  **Actionable Advice**: Give 2-3 specific, actionable recommendations to improve future results in Free Fire.
    
    Keep the tone encouraging but data-driven. Use markdown headings (like '### Overall Summary'), bold text for emphasis, and unordered lists for advice.
